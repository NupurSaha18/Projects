           During my semester break, I visited Sonargaon with eight of my friends. We spent a wonderful day exploring this historic place, which was once the ancient capital of Bengal. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the beautiful old architecture, especially the Panam City with its rows of century-old buildings. We enjoyed sightseeing around the Folk Art and Craft Museum, which showcases traditional Bangladeshi heritage. Besides exploring the history, we also had a lot of fun riding boats and trying different rides. The journey itself was lively, filled with laughter and excitement. Overall, it was a memorable trip where we experienced both the rich culture of Sonargaon and the joy of spending time together.
